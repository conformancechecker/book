    "In this notebook, we will explore how we can prepare data from an information system to the format that we need for conformance checking: **event logs**.  \n",
    "First, we need to load some data. We use the publicly available event data that was made available for the [Business Process Intelligence Challenge 2016 (BPIC'16)](https://www.win.tue.nl/bpi/doku.php?id=2016:challenge).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "* You should be able to follow the steps along this notebook. If you need further help, take a look at the [documentation of jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or [search for other tutorials online](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=jupyter+notebook+turorial).\n",
    "* You need Python 3 to run this notebook. There are many guides and tutorials, on how to set up Python 3 on common operating systems. \n",
    "* We **strongly encourage** you to run this notebook **locally** (to have better performance and faster processing).  \n",
    "Running this notebook locally, you need to make sure that the [requirements](https://github.com/conformancechecker/book/blob/master/requirements.txt) are installed:\n",
    "  * *Hint: create a virtual environment for this purpose. See [Creating virtual environments in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)*\n",
    "  * Then, a `pip install -r requirements.txt` should do the trick.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage Tips & Hints:\n",
    "* *Use \"Shift + Return\" to execute a cell and proceed to the next.*\n",
    "* We will loosely follow the phases from the process model for data mining (e.g. [Crisp-DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining)). In general, taking a step back and doing a bit of research on how to best approach a task is a good idea. \n",

The texts in the dataset are provided in both Dutch and English where applicable. URL's are included based on the structure of the site during the period the data has been collected. UWV is interested in insights on how their channels are being used, when customers move from one contact channel to the next and why and if there are clear customer profiles to be identified in the behavioral data. Furthermore, recommendations are sought on how to serve customers without the need to change the contact channel.\n",
